# Weather Hash

You're using the Weather Underground API to build out a weather report app! They're giving you awesome weather data in a hash that looks something like this: 

```ruby
{
	:city => "New York",
	:description => "Partly Cloudy",
	:temperature_farenheit => 66.3,
	:temperature_celcius => 19.1
}

```
