# Weather Hash

Today, you're using data from Weather Underground to build out a weather report app! They're giving you awesome weather data in a hash that looks something like this: 

```ruby
{
	:city => "New York",
	:description => "Partly Cloudy",
	:temperature_farenheit => 66.3,
	:temperature_celcius => 19.1
}

``` 

## Instructions

This lab is test driven, so first fork and clone or use the "Open in Nitrous" button. Following the tests, write methods that take in a weather hash as an argument and return the desired values.
